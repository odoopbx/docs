Backup
======
Before upgrading the asterisk plus module, it's crucial to take a backup of the current database and the asterisk plus module to ensure you have a fallback option in case of any issues during the upgrade process.

Check Compatibility: Verify that the Asterisk Plus module you want to upgrade is compatible with your current Odoo version. Some modules may have specific requirements or dependencies on other modules or Odoo versions. 

Obtain the New Module Version: Obtain the updated version of Asterisk Plus you wish to upgrade from the odoo app store.

Replace Module: Replace the old Asterisk Plus module with the new one. This typically involves copying the updated module into the appropriate custom addons folder of your Odoo installation.

Restart Odoo Server(Very Important): Restart Odoo server to initiate the upgrade process. Odoo will automatically detect the changes in the asterisk plus module files and perform necessary database updates.

Update the Module: In the Odoo user interface, navigate to the Apps menu and select the "Update Apps List" option to update the Asterisk Plus module list. Locate the module you want to upgrade and click on the "Upgrade" button. Odoo will execute any necessary database migrations and apply the module updates.Please note, you need to have the developer mode activated for you to perform this process.

Test and Verify: After the upgrade process is completed, thoroughly verify that the version has been upgraded. Test the functionality of the upgraded Asterisk Plus module to ensure it is working as expected. Verify that any configurations you made to the original module are still functioning correctly.
