System requirements

Installation on Ubuntu and Debian
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. code::

    apt update && apt -y install python3-pip python3-setproctitle
    pip3 install odoopbx

Installation on CentOS
++++++++++++++++++++++

Versions 6&7
++++++++++++
First, you should enable and install Python3 and pip.

There are at least `3 ways to install the latest Python3 package on CentOS <https://www.2daygeek.com/install-python-3-on-centos-6/>`_. 

Below is one of them (IUS).

.. code:: 

    curl 'https://setup.ius.io/' -o setup-ius.sh
    sh setup-ius.sh
    yum --enablerepo=ius install python36 python36-pip python36-setproctitle
    pip3 install odoopbx

.. warning::

   Please note that if you are using FreePBX, which is based on Centos 7, it has a different Python3 naming schema,
   similar to ius, but using Sangoma's own repositories. You shouldn't try to use 3rd party repositories,
   simply run ``yum makecache`` to get latest information from Sangoma's repositories and install Python3 by running 
   ``yum install python36u python36u-pip``

Version 8
+++++++++
Latest CentOS is quite ready for Python3. So here are the installation steps:

.. code::

    yum install python3 python3-pip python3-devel
    pip3 install odoopbx


Sangoma Linux release 7.8
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. code::

    yum install python36u python36u-pip python36u-devel
    pip3.6 install odoopbx
    

Installation errors
###################
During ``odoopbx install agent`` execution the following log lines are expected and they are normal:

.. code::
 
 14:16:12 - salt.loaded.ext.module.asteriskmod:40 - ERROR - ipsetpy lib not found, asterisk module not available.
 14:16:12 - salt.loaded.ext.module.odoomod:23 - INFO - OdooRPC lib not found, odoo module not available.

This is because these packages are going to be installed exactly during this operation.
