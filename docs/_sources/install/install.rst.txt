OdooPBX installation is managed by the OdooPBX Agent as it's not only the connection middleware
but also a deployment manager.

As you already might know, OdooPBX has the following components:

* Odoo / PostgreSQL
* Odoo addons
* Asterisk PBX
* The Agent
  
So, depending on your environment, you have to install the missing parts or everything is you start from zero.

In any case, the first step that must be done is downloading and installing the Agent.

Also, there are two different types of deployment:

* Docker deployment
* Standard installation

What type of installation to choose - you decide, use docker if you know what it is
and direct installation in the other case.

Also you could have a look at the demo setup instruction.
