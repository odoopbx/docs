============
Installation
============
OdooPBX installation is managed by the Saltstack configuration management tool
and includes formulas for installing all needed components:

* PostgreSQL database for Odoo;
* Odoo with the ``Asterisk Plus`` modules;
* Asterisk IP-PBX;
* Agent;
* Nginx frontend;
* Letsencrypt based PKI management.
  
Probably you already have some of components already running in your environment.
In this case you need to install the missing parts.

Next:

* :doc:`demo` (Quick all-in-one demo setup).
* :doc:`system` (system requirements)
* :doc:`standard` (preffered when Asterisk / Odoo should be installed).
* :doc:`docker` (most simple to connect to existing Odoo / Asterisk).
* :doc:`freepbx` (FreePBX is also possible to be run).
